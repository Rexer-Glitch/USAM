        <h1>The United States of Africa Movement Constitution</h1>
        <div id="constitution_intro">
          <p>
            Whereas we the citizens of Africa who are members of this movement
            are fortified in the view that we ore a duty to our continent to
            serve it with all our power within our individual and collective
            capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whereas Africa is the second largest continent in the world in terms
            of Population and Land Size, endowed with resources which do not
            translate into Economic Development. Whereas we who are members of
            this movement are joined in the realization that there is need to
            accelerate the integration of the continent and to form one big
            federation under one head called the United States of Africa.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whereas there is need for peaceful processes to engage the African
            Governments and to mobilize the citizens of Africa towards the
            formation of the United States of Africa and the creation of
            relevant structures. Realizing that none but ourselves can bring
            about this change in Africa.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further realizing that we ore a duty to generations to come to
            deliver to them an Africa they want, which is powerful and
            prosperous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further realizing that our children should not suffer the same
            humiliation that our forefathers suffered at the hands of those who
            were more powerful than them through the degrading and dehumanizing
            slave Trade and the Partition of Africa in Germany in (1884 -5)
            which brought about the states which we now call home under
            boundaries defined by the colonizers without the participation of
            Africa.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortified in the realization that we are not sons and daughters of a
            lesser God and that we are not condemned to being hewers of wood and
            drawers of water relegated to servile and Menial work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further fortified in the realization that Africa is the mother of
            mankind endowed with resources in its belly, home to about 1,4
            billion citizens and has capacity to develop and take its rightful
            place in the order of continents and or nations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing that all the African citizens need to liberate and
            emancipate themselves from the economic and political yokes of the
            past which have defined our continent, our country as the poorest in
            the world, a dumping site for second hand cars and second- hand
            clothes and a place where Europe would harvest Resources to develop
            its own industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further recognizing that Africa is capable of providing African
            solutions to African problems.
          </p>
          <p>AND</p>
          <p>
            Further taking into account everything said above together, it is no
            longer a duty but a calling for all the citizens of Africa to get
            their heads together and to curve a new path and deliver a United
            States of Africa which is powerful and prosperous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now therefore by this constitution which shall guide our thinking
            and vision we hereby constitute ourselves into a movement to be
            known as the United States of Africa Movement (hereinafter called
            USAM).
