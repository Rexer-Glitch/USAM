          Do you have African blood running in your veins or are you a friend of
          Africa by virtue of the fact that you identify and fully associate
          with Africans in their resolution to curve a new path for a new
          Africa?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that Africa is a very rich continent whose full
          potential is being suppressed by those who benefit from our divisions
          and love for national as opposed to continental sovereignty?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that Africa can rank among the best if not the best in
          the order of continents if we are united and if we put away
          self-political ambitions which benefit only a few to the exclusion of
          the general citizens of the African continent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you realize the poverty currently prevailing in Africa which
          poverty is induced and maintained by those who benefit from the status
          quo?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that none but the citizens of Africa can make Africa a
          great gigantic country called the United States of Africa?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you realize how back in history Africa has been humiliated and
          continues to be a laughing stock starting with the slave Trade, the
          scramble and partition of Africa through the Berlin Conference called
          by the then chancellor of Germany Otto Von Bismarck between December
          1884 and January 1885, regime change agendas and over burdening of
          Africa with debts effectively making it a charity case?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that given all the wealth which lies under her belly,
          mineral resources, land, 1.4 billion citizens and other resources
          there is absolutely no reason why Africa should be so poor?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that other countries such as China, Russia, America,
          Germany, India to mention but a few see great potential on the African
          table and get whatever they want from us almost for nothing because we
          are not united?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that our leaders at least after 1963 have not
          demonstrated any urgency at all to create this gigantic state called
          the United States of Africa and that one of the major reasons is
          self-preservation at the expense of the African masses? Our leaders do
          not want to legislate themselves out of power. They are so obsessed
          with power and that in their life time a United States of Africa is
          not an acceptable political entity. Its ease for them to talk of
          Agenda 2063.Is this the kind of urgency Africa wants?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that as a citizen of Africa you do not need a passport
          or visa to visit any African state nor do you need to undergo any
          major legal formalities to settle in any African state or establish
          business in any African state?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that the creation of regional blocks are cosmetic
          arrangements just to fool the African masses to believe that we are on
          course to full integration?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that if there is political will we do not even need 10
          years to integrate our continent into one political entity called the
          United States of Africa?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that Africa is very strong on Human capital? Its sons
          and daughters are running the economies of other countries. It has
          many of its sons and daughters spread across the world where they are
          treated as sons and daughters of a lesser God yet they have a very
          rich continent. Our footballers are boed and mocked as monkeys and
          baboons in Europe
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that the masses of Africa, speaking with one voice can
          convince our leaders, in our life time to integrate the African states
          into the United States of Africa and positively turn around the
          fortunes of the Continent?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you believe that the African Union (AU) cannot deliver a United
          States of Africa to the African masses given its current objectives
          and set up and the need to preserve national sovereignty by our
          leaders. Whoever proposes a United States of Africa will be labeled
          power hungry for wanting to become the first president of this
          gigantic country. Accordingly, only the African masses can be the
          natural mid wives of the United States of Africa (USA).

        Joined in these realizations and recognitions and mindful of the need to
        handover a united, strong and prosperous and one gigantic country to our
        future generations
      </strong>
      <p>
        <b>Realizing further that</b> our children should not suffer the same
        humiliation that our forefathers and ourselves suffered through the
        slave trade and colonization.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Further realizing that</b> unless we the citizens of Africa take
        action, and do it now, without any further rhetoric and political
        gimmicks and time-wasting adventures we are seriously under danger of
        another form of economic colonization where Africa is being mortgaged on
        a daily basis to a new set of colonizers who do so under cover of green
        grass.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fortified in the belief that</b> we are not sons and daughters of a
        lesser God and that we are not condemned to being hewers of wood and
        drawers of water.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Further fortified in the realization that</b> Africa is endowed with
        wealth and human capital with citizens in the region of 1. 4 billion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Recognizing that</b> all the African masses need to liberate
        themselves from the economic and political yokes of the Past which have
        defined our continent, our country as the poorest in the world, a
        dumping site for second hand clothes and used cars and a playground by
        those who consider themselves richer than us and deciders of who should
        rule us and who should not through the system of Regime change.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>It is no longer a duty but a calling</b> for all the citizens of this
        great country (<b>United States of Africa</b>) to make a complete break
        with the past and curve a new path where Africa should emerge from the
        shackles of poverty to become the most developed and industrialized
        country in the world. The greatest sin that each of us, the present
        generations can commit is to die before making Africa the greatest
        country in the world. In this revolution there are no leaders but
        everyone should lead from where ever he or she is and our collective
        efforts should deliver the Africa we want.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>By this declaration</b> a movement is hereby established, called the{" "}
        <b>United States of Africa movement</b> whose primary objective is to
        deliver to the African citizens a fully integrated Africa, politically,
        socially, religiously and economically in the true sense under a single
        political head, with one African Military and a single African currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Further realizing that</b> this creates a threat not only to those
        who do not want us to create ourselves into a strong political nation
        but also from amongst ourselves based on the fear of losing national
        sovereignty and personal political power, by the power and authority in
        each of us by virtue of being the citizens of Africa It is hereby
        resolved that the bus carrying our combined visions for a united states
        of Africa shall not have any brakes. Its brakes are designed to stop it
        only when it has reached its destination of delivering the United States
        of Africa to the citizens of Africa. Nothing shall stop our combined
        strength from achieving that goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>God bless Africa!</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>God bless the United States of Africa</b>
